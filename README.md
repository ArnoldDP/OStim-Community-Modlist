# Unofficial Ostim Community Modlist

**Disclaimer:**

The version out is the most up to date version of the list.

Ace's post is a little bit outdated. The list is now 320 gigs. Deleting the downloads folder once its installed can save around 120gb of storage, but it still might be a bit shocking to see the difference in size.

 ### Description
 
 
* What this isnt

This is not pornrim with barely clothed women, public masturebation, and sexually aggressive wolves, it is not a hyperrealistic soulslike with a grueling survival mode and a map size that rivals Daggerfall, and it isn't a lore breaking power fantasy where you're practically a god. It's also not a Phoenix Flavor based modlist (no disrespect to the authors) with the small addition of OStim.

* What this is

 It's a lore friendly and aesthetically pleasing overhaul for nearly every aspect of the game. Featuring mods like At Your Own Pace, Seasons of Skyrim, OStim, and Sunhelm Survival, this is list made to give a complete roleplaying experience to as many people as possible. Tl;dr this is a list for immersiphiles.

 <summary>Pre-installation and Requirements</summary>
 
 ### Preinstallation
 
 It is recommended that you start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim through the Steam store (no GOG, sorry). A modified version may fail to install properly, if at all.
 If you downgraded, validate your files by going to your library, right clicking "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition", select properties, local files, and then click verify integrity of game files. Alternatively, you can completely uninstall the game and all related files and then reinstall it. After thats done, you can proceed with the installation.
 
 ### Requirements
 
 The only hard requirements to run this modlist are a CPU with AVX2 support and ~300 gigs of storage available.
 
> Recommended specs for 1080p:
> 
> CPU: Ryzen 5 5600/intel i5 11600
>  
> GPU: RTX 3060 8gb/RX 6600 8gb
>  
> RAM: 16gb ddr4 @2666 mhz
> 
> ~~Basically just generic gaming pc built after 2020~~
> 
> Obviously if your hardware is better, there shouldn't be any issues.
 
 I tried to keep the textures around 1-2k, but a few misc items, notably mountains and skin textures, are higher resolution. While the graphical fidelity isn't anywhere near as high as some modlists, it accomplishes my goal of making a list that looks nice, runs nice, and "feels" nice.
 
 ### Previous Versions
 
 If you were using a previous version of this list, it is recommended that you *completely uninstall it* before updating to the new version. It's also recommended to start a completely new save, if you really need to use your current save you can clean your save using Fallrim tools, but this may be unstable.

### ENB

 Two ENB presets are included. Rudy for NAT, and my own personal blend of Verdenna + PRT + NAT. Don't like either of them? Thats fine! I have a small guide in the "Root Builder" section that you can use to swap the ENB for anything you want.
 
### Alternate Start
 
 I didn't go with the generic alternate start because I'm super funny and quirky (I dont want to support Arthmoor any more than I have to). Instead, Realm of Lorkhan is used, so make your murderhobo and have fun. If you get a message like "OStim not ready for installation", don't worry, its just script lag.
 
 ### Hotkeys and Game Settings
 
* Audio
 
Every pair of ears and set of headphones is different so audio balance does not come preconfigued. You should change this to your liking
 
* Display

This does come preconfigured. I dont recommend changing it, but if you think your system can handle it you should probably use BethINI to edit this instead of the Skyrim Launcher or in game settings.
 
* Hotkeys and non-vanilla controls

END: Kreate menu

Shift + Enter: ENB Menu

Shift + Home: Improved Camera

Backspace: Immersive equipment display

Scroll Lock: Open Animation Replacer menu

 ### Bugs and Installation Failures
 
 * **Low FPS In Whiterun:** This isn't really a bug, just a side effect of the exterior mods and the density of the grass. I did do a bit of a bandaid fix that aleviates most of the problems, but you might still have some minor frame drops.
 
 This list only really gets updated whenever any of the major mods it uses do, so small bugs may survive for a while. If you find any anything, please report them to me on discord @arnoldp
 
If for any reason the Wabbajack installation fails, please DM me

On the off chance that the game doesnt automatically downgrade, you can use the patcher below.

  <summary>A Brief explanation of some of some of the various things this list covers</summary>
 
 ### Gameplay changes and rebalancing
 
 * Melee
 
Melee combat is handled by ADXP + One Click Power Attack NG, and Valvalis Combat - Visceral Tactics. Valvalis is a patch that allows the mods Precision, Valhalla Combat, and Valravyn to work together in a cohesive way and introduce new mechanics like timed blocks/attacks, stamina based combat, and better AI. Dodge - MCO/DXP is also included becuase of course it is, who do you think I am?

Chemmings Nordic animations for ADXP/MCO were chosen because I just felt like it would fit the best, but you are free to swap it out with any ADXP/MCO compatible moveset you'd like.

You are free to disable all of this, as long as you rerun Nemesis. The mods can be found in the ***Gameplay - Melee*** separator.
 
 * Magic
 
Magic has had dozens of new spells added to the game, some spells are easily aquired and some are hidden throughout the world. I also included Spellsiphon, an incredibly unique gameplay mod you can be integrated into any magic oriented playstyle

 * Races
 
Racial abilities are covered by a combination of Mannaz and Freyr. These mods overhaul the generic racial abilities and provide unique standing stone abilities based on your race. This makes races a more important part of character creation, but not to the point where there is a clearly defined "meta"

 * Perks
 
Perks are (temporarily) handled by Vokriinator black. This is a patch that ccombines several perk overhaul mods from various authors. This provides you with a massive perk tree that allows for an astounding number of builds for you to come up with.

I made the mistake of generating LODs while playing around with something, will be reverted in the near future

 * Vampires and Werewolves
 
Lycanthropy and Vampirism are handled by Growl and Sacrilege. These two mods make small adjustments to the balance of these "diseases" that allows for more diverse playstyles. Vampires are no longer limited to running a restoration build and werewolves are actually playable.

 * Stealth
 
Stealth had a few changes to make the vanilla thief more interesting. Book of Shadows adds several new systems such as takedowns, smokebombs, and more. Take a Peak is also included, and allows you to simply look through keyholes, maybe you'll see something fun? :^)
 
 * Survival
 
 Survival is handled by Sunhelm Survival and Camping Lite. These two mods are lightweight, customizable, and entirely optional. There's a small quest that involves sleeping in a bed if you'd like to start survival mode, but you can also enable/disable it through the MCM.
 
 * Camera
 
 True directional movement and Smoothcam are used to make third person gameplay feel a bit more modern. I included a few smoothcam presets, but theres hundreds that you can download off of Nexus if you dont like the prepackaged ones (or you can just turn off smoothcam in the MCM). First person is handled by Improved Camera. It comes with an optional configuration for clippingless fpv OStim scenes

 * User Interface
 
The vanilla UI has been completely overhauled by several, fully customizable mods. While the HUD has been pre-configured, feel free to modify it in any way youd like. Everything used is found in the **UI** section.
 
 * Followers
 
Several new and fully voiced followers have been added to the game, some of which even have OStim supported "romance" *wink*

Vanilla followers are managed using Nethers Follower Framework. Please do not port any non-vanilla voiced follower into the framework. It will most likely break them.
 
Almost all of these gameplay mods can be completely ignored, or fully embraced. The choice is yours.

 ### The World

 * Towns and Cities

Many of the towns and cities have been expanded on, or overhauled entirely. All of these changes are meant to be lore friendly and simply seak to make the are feel more alive.

 * Random places

Many notable but underwhelming places have been updated to feel a bit more important. Ryn's mods make up the bulk of these changes, but there are a few others thrown in for a bit more flavor.

 * Additions

Several small but unique places from various mods have been added, and while they arent massive new lands with hundreds of quests, they do make our little section of Tamriel feel a bit more lively.

These mods in tandem with Skyrim's Paraglider and the new SkyClimb mod make exploration feel like a brand new experience. Even the most hardened Skyrim veterans will have a whole trove of secrets to uncover if they so choose.

  <summary>OStim</summary>
  
  ### OStim
  
   OStim integration was the primary focus of the list and what separates it from other "immsersion" focused modlists. There's too much to cover all at once here, so I'll just use a few of my favorites.
 
 * Rift's Rest
 
 A Witcher style brothel located in Riften. There's a few short stories centered around it that you might enjoy. 
 
 * OStim NPCs
 
 Allows NPCs to engage in scenes without your input. You might find some bandits having fun in a cave and you might hear some noises coming from a locked door in your local inn
  
 * OStim Lovers
 
 This is a mod that adds fully voiced romance options to several vanilla NPCs, think of it as a newer Armorous Adventures. It was mainly intended for a female PC, but its 2023 so use it as you see fit

 * Immersive Wenches

A fairly large mod that adds several quests, NPCs, and encounters to the game, all with OStim integration.
 
> OStim and its add-ons are configurable through their respective MCMs, most of them are neatly grouped together and can be found by just typing "O" in the MCM filter.
 
 Remember, OStim isnt just another sex mod, it adds another level of depth and realism to the game.

 <summary>Audio</summary>

 # Audio

 While this list isn't built to be an auditory experience, I am still a bit of an audiophile, so naturally some things have been changed
 
 ### SFX
 
 Every vanilla sound has been improved or changed. A lot of these changes can be subjective, but luckily they can all be easily disabled by scrolling down to the ***Sounds*** seperator in MO2
 
 ### Music
 
 Just like SFX, the vanilla OST has improved clarity and several new songs have been added. This kind of stuff is rather subjective so feel free to disable Around the Fire, Nyghtfall, and Nordenhamr, if you only want the vanilla OST.

<details>
  <summary>Root Builder</summary>
 
 ### Root builder
 
 This is a MO2 plugin that can be used for anything that needs to be installed to the root directory of your game. This allows for easy management of things like skse, engine fixes, and ENB presets. While it can usually install simple things like older ENBs just fine, you should still make sure its done properly.
 
 To install a mod through root builder, select manual
 
 ![image](https://github.com/ArnoldDP/OStim-Community-Modlist/assets/122011472/b62aa5e3-ead0-4928-a00a-0649b42f94f7)
 
 Right click <data> and create a new directory named "root"
 
 Drag everything that should be installed to the root directory of your game into the "root" folder that you just created. Disable everything else.
 
 ![image](https://github.com/ArnoldDP/OStim-Community-Modlist/assets/122011472/77ba3828-d458-403a-b683-874c3b90c7b2)
 
Now just click okay. You can manage this like any other mod.
 
ReShade can also be managed by root builder, but the setup can be a bit more finnicky. First install the reshade preset youd like to the version of the game that comes with this modlist. Now create an empty mod in MO2, open it in explorer and create a "root" folder inside of it. Drag and drop all of the files that ReShade installed into that root folder that you just created. If you're confused by the initial ReShade installation process, Sswaye has written an excellent guide that can be found here https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78502


 
 ### Parallax

Most of the included textures are Complex Parallax compatible. If an ENB preset you installed doesnt have complex parallax enabled by default, open up the enbseries.ini, and change the following settings to look like this

 1. EnableTerrainParallax=false
 2. EnableComplexGrass=true
 3. EnableComplexGrassCollisions=true
 4. EnableTerrainBlending=true
 5. EnableComplexParallax=true
 6. EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
 7. EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
 8. EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true

 
 If any of these lines are missing from the enbseries.ini, you can simply copy and paste the missing lines into the file. It will work just fine.

If you want to run NAT, Azurite, Vivid Weathers, or Aequinoctium weathers, you should enable ***FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps Weather and Lighting Fix.esp***
