# Ostim Community Modlist

### Disclaimer

Ace's post is a little bit outdated. The list is now (roughly) 335 gigabytes. Deleting the downloads folder once its installed can save around 125gb of storage, but it still might be a bit shocking to see the difference in size.

### News!

Unofficial beta is over, soon to be on the gallery.

I also now have a Discord for updates, feedback, and support. Feel free to join! [OCM Support discord](https://discord.gg/MgDsHfmCEF)

 <summary>Description</summary>

 ### Description

   * What this is

It's a lore friendly and aesthetically pleasing overhaul for nearly every aspect of the game. Featuring mods like Experience, JaySerpa's Quest Expansions, At Your Own Pace, Seasons of Skyrim, and OStim, this is a list made to give you a complete roleplaying experience 
 
  * What this isnt

This is ***not*** pornrim with skimpy armor, public masturebation, and sexually aggressive wolves. It is not a hyperrealistic soulslike with a grueling survival mode and a map size that rivals Daggerfall. It isn't a lore breaking power fantasy where you become a god at level 15. It's also not a Phoenix Flavor based modlist (no disrespect to the authors) with the small addition of OStim.

 <summary>Pre-installation and Requirements</summary>
 
 ### Preinstallation
 
 You are required to start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim SE/AE through the Steam store. If you are unsure of how to do this, I recommend following GamerPoets guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ5uNCKOKmI)

 If you fail to start with a clean installation, the list will most likely not install. 
 
 ### Requirements
 
 The only hard requirements to run the modlist are a CPU with AVX2 support and ~300 gigs of storage available.
 
> Recommended min specs for 1080p (Default profile):
> 
> CPU: Ryzen 5 5600/intel i5 11600S
>  
> GPU: RTX 3060 8gb/RX 6600 8gb
>  
> RAM: 16gb ddr4 @2666 mhz
> 
> ~~Basically just generic gaming pc built after 2020~~

 With the above specs, you can expect an average of 50 fps for most of the overworld and 60+ for most interiors.
 
 For the optional CS - NAT and CS - RAID profiles, I'm honestly not sure what the minimum specs are. The FPS difference can be as high as 40 and as low as 0 in places that are limited by draw calls.
 
 ### Previous Versions
 
 If you were using a version prior to the OStim Standalone/Simonrim/Community Shaders update, it is recommended that you start a completely new save (yes this means no falhrim save cleaner or similar tools). If you were using one of the more recent updates, you should be fine with just the clean save procedure. 

 To perform a clean save
 
> 1. Move to a safe area (I prefer Riverwood Trader) and save your game.
>
> 3. Install the newest version of the modlist.
>
> 3. Load your save, it will complain about missing mods, this doesnt matter.
>
> 4. Leave the area you saved in and run around outside for a few minutes, switch cells a couple times, maybe even kill a thing or two
>
> 5. Save your game wherever youre standing
>
> 6. Use [FallrimTools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/) to open your save
>
> 7. Follow the instrution on the FallrimTools page to clean your save
>
> 8. Play the game normally

### Profiles

While you are free to, I can't say I recommend switching mid save. Doing so disables several mods and enables several others, this could break your save later down the road.

 * ENB - NAT

The Default profile. Much worse performance but better (???) graphics. Expect 45-55 fps in most exteriors if you have the recommended specs. Comes with your choice of a custom ENB preset made by yours truly, or Rudy for NAT. They have roughly the same performance but wildly different aesthetics.

 * CS - NAT

Deep heavily contrasted shadows and bright sunlight. Expect 60-80 fps in most exteriors if you have the recommended specs.

 * CS - RAID

Lower contrast shadows and brighter nights, very nice for gameplay. Expect 65 - 85 fps in most exteriors if you have the recommended specs.

### Alternate Start
 
 I didn't go with the generic Alternate Start - Choose Your Own Perspective. Instead, Alternate Perspective with Jayserpa's voiced mod is used. Try out the "Vanilla" start option, or pick a rolelpay!
 
### Hotkeys and Game Settings
 
 * Audio
 
Since every pair of ears and set of headphones is different, audio balance does not come preconfigued. You should configure this for yourself.
 
 * Display

This does come preconfigured. I dont recommend changing it, but if you think your system can handle it, you should probably use BethINI to edit this instead of the Skyrim Launcher or in game settings.
 
 * Hotkeys and non-vanilla controls

**Home**: ReShade Menu/Open Animation Replacer GUI. Cycle through them by hitting home multiple times

**F11** dMenu.

**Z** Wheeler. This and the rest of its associated hotkeys can easily be viewed and changed in dMenu

**END**: Community Shaders window (CS profile only)

**Shift + Enter**: ENB Menu (Default profile only)

**Shift + Home**: Improved Camera

**Backspace**: Immersive equipment display

**V**: Step Dodge

**V (double tap)**: Dodge roll

**Shift + Right click**: Power attack

**Left click (hold)**: Continued normal attacks

 ### Bugs and Installation Failures
 
  * **Low FPS In Whiterun:** This isn't really a bug, just a side effect of the exterior mods and the density of the grass. I did do a bit of a bandaid fix that aleviates most of the problems, but you might still have some minor frame drops.

 * **Weird Snow Shader in Winter Season:** I'm trying to find a fix for it. If you know anything about this, please DM me at any time.

Please do not hesitate to report any other bugs in the [OCM Support discord](https://discord.gg/MgDsHfmCEF)

If for any reason the Wabbajack installation fails, please DM me

On the off chance that the game doesnt automatically downgrade, you can use [the patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618)

  <summary>Some of the things the list covers</summary>
 
 ### Simonrim

This list uses almost the full Simonrim Suite, along with a few other lightweight mods, to make the game feel just a little bit more modern. 

 * Melee

Melee combat is handled by Attack - Distar Experience, along with Blade & Blunt + Valhalla. This introduces things like stamina based combat, injuries, and timed blocking. Dodge - Motion Combat Overhaul is also included because of course it is, who do you think I am?

 * Magic

Dozens of unique new spells have been added to the game to make mage classes feel just a little bit more complete. Gameplay mods such as Sorcerer and Spellsiphon are also included to make magic feel more interactive and flexible.

 * Stealth
 
Stealth had a few changes to make the vanilla thief more interesting. Book of Shadows adds several new systems such as takedowns, smokebombs, and more. Take a Peak is also included, and allows you to simply look through keyholes, maybe you'll see something fun? :^)

 * Survival

Starfrost in conjunction with Campsight make up the bulk of the survival gameplay. When combined with Seasons of Skyrim and a few other small mods included in this list, survival feels like a natural part of the game. If you do not want to play in survival mode, simply turn it off in the gameplay settings menu. 

### UX

 * Camera
 
True directional movement and Smoothcam are used to make third person gameplay feel a bit more modern. I included a few smoothcam presets, but theres hundreds that you can download off of Nexus if you dont like the prepackaged ones (or you can just turn off smoothcam in the MCM). First person is handled by Improved Camera. It comes with an optional configuration for clippingless fpv OStim scenes

 * User Interface
 
The vanilla UI has been completely overhauled by several mods. While the UI does come preconfigured, you're more than welcome to modify it. The main mods you'll need to worry about are TrueHUD, MoreHUD, and A Matter of Time.

 * Photo Mode

This adds a fully functional photo mode, inspired by later Bethesda titles. Read more about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91701)

 * Wheeler and dMenu

[Wheeler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345) is the new wheel menu by dTry. It adds an incredibly fast and simple wheel function to the game. The hotkeys do not come preconfigured, but you can change them using [dMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97221). Since these are both incredibly flexible mods, I highly recommend reading both of the mod pages to see what they can do.

### Followers

 * Nether's Follower Framework

Vanilla followers are handled by Nether's Follower Framework. Please do not import custom voiced followers (unless otherwise stated) into the framework. NFF can be managed in the "follower framework" MCM.

 * Custom Followers

Custom voiced followers are made by some of the most passionate modders you'll ever meet, and are the majority of the list's new quests.

[Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) Adorable cannibalistic wood elf girl (Is managed by NFF)

[Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) imperial nerd researching the dwemer

[Caesia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13389) Haven't spent a lot of time with her either, recommend reading her page

[M'rissi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9666) Catgirl with a lot of personality

[Taliesin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93413) A bit fruity, a bit edgy, probably won't try to kill you

[Secunda](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93739) I'd call her a sweetheart but she'd probably resort to autocannibalism

[Bjorn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91652) The new kid on the block, hates bandits as much as Lydia

[IFD - Lydia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38473) Hates bandits as much as Bjorn (Is managed by NFF)

[Vayne](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77924) *The* dunmer waifu

[Coralyn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79669) Another wood elf, but with less cannibalism


 ### The World

 * Towns and Cities

Many of the towns and cities have been expanded on, or overhauled entirely. All of these changes are meant to be lore friendly and simply seak to make the game feel more alive.

 * Random places

Many notable but underwhelming places have been updated to feel a bit more important. Ryn's mods make up the bulk of these changes, but there are a few others thrown in for a bit more flavor.

 * Additions

Several small but unique places from various mods have been added, and while they arent massive new lands with hundreds of quests, they do make our little section of Tamriel feel a bit more lively.

These mods in tandem with Skyrim's Paraglider and the new SkyClimb mod make exploration feel like a brand new experience. Even the most hardened Skyrim veterans will have a whole trove of secrets to uncover if they so choose.

  <summary>OStim</summary>
  
  ### OStim
  
   OStim integration was the primary focus of the list and what separates it from other "immersion" focused modlists. There's too much to cover all at once here, so I'll just use a few of my favorites.
 
  * Rift's Rest
 
 A Witcher style brothel located in Riften. There's a few short stories centered around it that you might enjoy. 
 
  * OStim NPCs
 
 Allows NPCs to engage in scenes without your input. You might find some bandits having fun in a cave and you might hear some noises coming from a locked door in your local inn
  
  * OStim Lovers
 
 This is a mod that adds fully voiced romance options to several vanilla NPCs, think of it as a newer Armorous Adventures. It was mainly intended for a female PC, but its 2023 so use it as you see fit

 * Immersive Wenches

A fairly large mod that adds several quests, NPCs, and encounters to the game, all with OStim integration.
 
> OStim and its add-ons are configurable through their respective MCMs, most of them are neatly grouped together and can be found by just typing "O" in the MCM filter.
 
 Remember, OStim isnt just another sex mod, it adds another level of depth and realism to the game.

 <summary>Audio</summary>

 # Audio

 While this list isn't built to be an auditory experience, everyone likes good audio. 
 
 ### SFX
 
 Every vanilla sound has been improved or changed. A lot of these changes can be subjective, but luckily they can all be easily disabled by scrolling down to the ***Sounds*** seperator in MO2
 
 ### Music
 
 Just like SFX, the vanilla OST has improved clarity and songs from the mods Nyghtfall, Around the Fire, and Still have been added. This kind of stuff is also incredibly subjective, so feel free to disable the three mods and the assicated

<details>
  <summary>Root Builder</summary>
 
 ### Root builder
 
 This is a MO2 plugin that can be used for anything that needs to be installed to the root directory of your game. This allows for easy management of things like skse, engine fixes, and ENB presets. While it can usually install simple things like older ENBs just fine, you should still make sure its done properly.
 
 To install a mod through root builder, select manual
 
 ![image](https://github.com/ArnoldDP/OStim-Community-Modlist/assets/122011472/b62aa5e3-ead0-4928-a00a-0649b42f94f7)
 
 Right click <data> and create a new directory named "root"
 
 Drag everything that should be installed to the root directory of your game into the "root" folder that you just created. Disable everything else.
 
 ![image](https://github.com/ArnoldDP/OStim-Community-Modlist/assets/122011472/77ba3828-d458-403a-b683-874c3b90c7b2)
 
Now just click okay. You can manage this like any other mod.
 
ReShade can also be managed by root builder, but the setup can be a bit more finnicky. First install the reshade preset youd like to the version of the game that comes with this modlist. Now create an empty mod in MO2, open it in explorer and create a "root" folder inside of it. Drag and drop all of the files that ReShade installed into that root folder that you just created. If you're confused by the initial ReShade installation process, Sswaye has written an excellent guide that can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78502)

I am making a small video guide on this process, just incase you found it confusing.


 
 ### Parallax

Most of the included textures are Complex Parallax compatible. If an ENB preset you installed doesnt have complex parallax enabled by default, open up the enbseries.ini, and change the following settings to look like this

 1. EnableTerrainParallax=false
 2. EnableComplexGrass=true
 3. EnableComplexGrassCollisions=true
 4. EnableTerrainBlending=true
 5. EnableComplexParallax=true
 6. EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
 7. EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
 8. EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true

 
 If any of these lines are missing from the enbseries.ini, you can simply copy and paste the missing lines into the file. It will work just fine.

If you want to run NAT, Azurite, Vivid Weathers, or Aequinoctium weathers, you should enable ***FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps Weather and Lighting Fix.esp***
