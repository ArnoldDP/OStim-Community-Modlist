# Ostim Community Modlist

Hello and thank you for reading this messy page, its currently a bit out of date unfortunately but we do have a [discord server for people who need a little bit of support](https://discord.gg/vYkTp86CcZ).

<details>
 <summary>Description</summary>

 ### Description

   * What this is

OCM is meant to expand on Skyrim with more modern RPG elements while simultaneously making it feel more lifelike and immersive. It does not include any new lands (e.g. Bruma) or large quests (e.g. LoTD) and the adult themed content is entirely optional.
 
  * What this isnt

This is ***not*** pornrim with skimpy armor, public masturebation, and sexually aggressive wolves. While OStim is a sex mod framework, that doesn't mean that it has to be a $5 Steam hentai game.

 <summary>Pre-installation and Requirements</summary>
 
 ### Pre-installation
 
 You are required to start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim SE/AE through the Steam store. If you are unsure of how to do this, I recommend following GamerPoets guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ5uNCKOKmI)

 If you fail to start with a clean installation, the list will most likely not install. 

 The game language also needs to be set to English. I'd assume you can change the localization afterwards but I honestly don't know due to being an ignorant English speaking American. My appologies.
 
 ### Requirements
 
 The only hard requirements to run the modlist are a CPU with AVX2 support and ~450 gigs of storage available.
 
> Recommended min specs for 1080p (Default profile):
> 
> CPU: Ryzen 5 5600/intel i5 11600S
>  
> GPU: RTX 3060 8gb/RX 6600 8gb
>  
> RAM: 16gb ddr4 @2666 mhz
> 
> ~~Basically just generic gaming pc built after 2020~~

 With the above specs, you can expect an average of 60 fps on the CS - Low profile at 1080p.

 I'm honestly not entirely sure what the minimum specs are for 1080p but fwiw I have a 5600x, an RTX 4070ti, 32gbs of ram, and I play at 2560x1080 ultrawide.

  <summary>A general overview</summary>

Seeing as the list is, for the most part, an expansion of vanilla content (Skyrim, Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire), it is a very vanilla+ list. 

Simonrim's suite of mods cover just about everything from cooking to combat. 

Sunhelm, Camping Lite, and Horizon Zero Dawn Fast Travel are used to make survival mode feel the way I think it should. 

Magic overhauls aren't particularly common relative to the other systems in Skyrim but I tried to make it feel a little bit more interactive with hundreds of new spells, Spellsiphon, and a fairly simple and gameplay friendly Lichdom mod.

With Seasons of Skyrim, a multitude of overhauls, and several new interesting places you can visit, it just felt fitting to add the paraglider and SkyClimb mods to make exploration feel just a little bit more modern.

Several of the quests, including the main story, have been overhauled by AYOP and JaySerpas various quest expansion mods. You also gain experience from exploration and completing quests as opposed to grinding your way through Bethesdas rather lackluster dungeons.

  <summary>OStim</summary>

  Obviously this list does have a fair amount of OStim integration. While most of it can be completely ignored if you want to, there are a few things to watch out for.

  * Brothels

    Theres two of them. The Rift's Rest (Riften) and The Naked Dragon (Markarth) are exactly what they sound like, whorehouses where you can go to do various things with various people.

  * A few of the followers

    Several of the followers, namely Auri, Caesia, Nessa, Kaidan, and M'rissi have OStim integration in their romance quests.

  * General Dialogue

    OStim Romance adds a fairly simple and straightforward dialogue based way to get people in bed with you.

 <summary>Audio</summary>

 # Audio

 While this list isn't built to be an auditory experience, everyone likes good audio. 
 
 ### SFX
 
 Every vanilla sound has been improved or changed. Most of this comes from Audio Overhaul for Skyrim, Immersive Sounds Compendium, several SFX replacers by Satafinix, and Unofficial HD Audio Project. These mods cannot be safely disabled without running your own syntehsis patch.
 
 ### Music
 
 Just like SFX, the vanilla OST has improved clarity and songs from the mods Nyghtfall, Around the Fire, and Still have been added. The additions can be incredibly subjective, so you can easily disable it by disabling "big old music mod" in the **Audio** separator.

  <summary>Root Builder</summary>
 
 ### Root builder
 
 This is a MO2 plugin that I use to manage things like ENBs, ReShade, and SKSE.

 Chooey has made an amazing four minute guide on what it is and how to use it.
