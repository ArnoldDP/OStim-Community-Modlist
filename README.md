# Unofficial Ostim Community Modlist

**Disclaimer:**

I am currently in the process of cleaning and updating the list, the downloadable version you see below will be the last version that uses Skyrim version 1.6.353. The next version will be on 1.5.97, have most of the bugs fixed, three profiles with varying levels of performance and graphical fidelity to choose from, and a streamlined and easy way to disable combat mods if youd rather play with vanilla combat. While you are 100% free to download the version thats availible right now, it might not be exactly what you're looking for, and its not at the standards I'm holding the next update to.

Ace's post is a little bit outdated. The modlist has grown quite a bit at this point, and now has a few things that some people might find rather subjective. It's also totalling around 250gb as opposed to the advertised 140. A lot of this can be saved by simply clearing out the downloads folder after its installed, but some people might still be shocked by this.

In the future I might put together a stripped down version with just the bare essentials, but thats the future.

 <summary>Description</summary>

 ### Description
 
 
* What this isnt

This is not pornrim with barely clothed women, public masturebation, and sexually aggressive wolves, nor it is a hyperrealistic soulslike with a grueling survival mode and a map size that rivals Daggerfall. It's also not an Elysium Remastered clone (no disrespect to the author) with the small addition of OStim.

* What this is

 It's an aesthetically pleasing and immersive overhaul for nearly every aspect of the game, while adding plenty of spicy roleplay opportunities :^)

The gameplay mods are customizable enhancers to the experience. A lot of subjective quest mods were avoided because they could cause unnecessary bloat.

 <summary>Preinstallation and Requirements</summary>
 
 ### Preinstallation
 
 It is recommended that you start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim through the Steam store (no GOG, sorry). A modified version may fail to install properly, if at all.
 If you downgraded, validate your files by going to your library, right clicking "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition", select properties, local files, and then click verify integrity of game files. Alternatively, you can completely uninstall the game and all related files and then reinstall it. After thats done, you can proceed with the installation.
 
 ### Requirements
 
 The only hard requirements to run this modlist are a CPU with AVX2 support and ~250 gigs of storage available.
 
> Recommended specs for 1080p:
> 
> CPU: Ryzen 5 5600/intel i5 11600k
>  
> GPU: RTX 3060 8gb/RX 6600 8gb
>  
> RAM: 16gb ddr4 @2666 mhz
> 
> ~~Basically just generic gaming pc built after 2020~~
> 
> Obviously if your hardware is better, there shouldn't be any issues.
 
 I tried to keep the textures around 1-2k, but a few misc items, notably mountains and skin textures, are higher resolution. While the graphical fidelity isn't anywhere near as high as some modlists, it accomplishes my goal of making a list that looks nice, runs nice, and "feels" nice.
 
 ### Previous Versions
 
 If you were using a previous version of this list, it is recommended that you delete everything but the downloads folder before you install the new version. It's also recommended to start a completely new save, if you really need to use your current save you can clean your save using Fallrim tools, but this may be unstable.

   <summary>Post-installation</summary>
 
### Alternate Start
 
 I didn't go with the generic alternate start because I'm super funny and quirky. Instead, Realm of Lorkhan is used, make your murderhobo and have fun. If you get a message like "OStim not ready for installation", don't worry, its just script lag.
 
 ### Game settings and MCM
 
* Audio
 
Audio balance is not preconfigured, if you're fine with the base audio settings, then you have nothing to worry about. If you're not, open up the audio settings and change it to your liking.
 
* Open Animation Replacer
 
 The default key to open the menu for this is Scroll Lock. This might conflict with other mods you want to install, so feel free to change it at any point.
 
* Improved Camera
 
 While the OStim fpv camera settings do come pre-installed, the camera still uses the default settings until you change it. To open up the Improved Camera menu, just hold shift and hit the "home" key on your keyboard. You can either use the OStim camera settings (recommended) or modify it in any way you'd like
 
* MiniMap
 
Hit "n" to toggle the minimap on and off, its position is customizable in its ini file
 
* Kreate
 
 Kreate is an in game gui that allows you to modify your weather/lighting/time of day whenever you want without the use of console commands. While it can be used for super complex things (like Skies Above), I just use it for screenshots. It's default key is END

  <summary>Known issues</summary>
 
 ### Bugs and Installation Failures
 
 * **Low FPS In Whiterun:** This isn't really a bug, just a side effect of the exterior mods and the density of the grass. It's potentially the heaviest area in the game.
 
 * **Strange missing texture in witchmist grove:** Working on it
 
 * **Weird AI Pathing in Whiterun:** Most likely a navmesh problem, working on it
 
 This list only really gets updated whenever any of the major mods it uses do, so small bugs may survive for a while. If you find any major/gamebreaking bugs, please report them to me on discord @arnoldp
 
If for any reason the Wabbajack installation fails, please DM me

On the off chance that the game doesnt automatically downgrade, you can use the patcher below.

  <summary>A Brief explanation of the "major" gameplay changes</summary>
 
 ### Gameplay changes and rebalancing
 
 
 * Melee
 
Melee combat is handled by ADXP/MCO + One Click Power Attack NG, and Valvalis Combat - Visceral Tactics. Valvalis is a patch that allows the mods Precision, Valhalla Combat, and Valravyn to work together in a cohesive way and introduce new mechanics like timed blocks/attacks, stamina based combat, and better AI. Dodge - MCO/DXP is also included becuase of course it is, who do you think I am?
 
Tap V to step dodge, double tap to roll. Hold left click for continued normal attacks, or hold shift and tap right click for a power attack. Power attacks can be chained. You can configure your keybinds in their respective MCMs.

Chemmings Nordic animations for ADXP/MCO were chosen because I just felt like it would fit the best, but you are free to swap it out with any ADXP/MCO compatible moveset you'd like.
 
 * Magic
 
Magic has had dozens of new spells added to the game, some spells are easily aquired and some are hidden throughout the world. I also included Spellsiphon, an incredibly unique gameplay mod that can automatically integrate almost any spell into its system.

 * Races
 
Racial abilities are covered by a combination of Mannaz and Freyr. These mods overhaul the generic racial abilities and provide unique standing stone abilities based on your race, making this part of character creation much more important.

 * Perks
 
Perks are handled by Vokrii. This is an extremely lightweight and minimalistic approach to perk overhauls. You can enjoy the small quality of life improvements it makes without being overwhelmed by an absurd number of changes.

 * Vampires and Werewolves
 
Lycanthropy and Vampirism are handled by Growl and Sacrilege. These two mods, like Vokrii, make small adjustments to the balance of these "diseases" that allows for more diverse and fun playstyles.

 * Stealth
 
Stealth had a few changes to make the vanilla thief more interesting. Book of Shadows adds several new systems such as takedowns, smokebombs, and more. Take a Peak is also included, and allows you to simply look through keyholes, maybe you'll see something fun? :^)
 
 * Survival
 
 Survival is handled by Sunhelm Survival and Camping Lite. These two mods are lightweight, customizable, and entirely optional. There's a small quest that involves sleeping in a bed if you'd like to start survival mode, but you can also enable/disable it through the MCM.
 
 * Camera
 
 True directional movement and Smoothcam are used to make third person gameplay feel a bit more modern. I included a few smoothcam presets, but theres hundreds that you can download off of Nexus if you dont like either of them (or you can just turn off smoothcam in the MCM). First person is handled by Improved Camera. It comes with an optional configuration for clippingless fpv OStim scenes
 
 * User Interface
 
 The vanilla UI has been completely overhauled by several, fully customizable mods. While the HUD has been pre-configured, feel free to modify it in any way youd like. Everything used is found in the **UI** section.
 
 * Followers
 
 Several new followers have been added to the game, some of which even have OStim supported "romance" *wink*
 
 Nethers Follower Framework is used to manage non-custom followers and has several options that can be configured in the Follower Framework MCM. Auri is the only custom follower, to my knowledge, that will automatically be imported and managed by the framework. Please do not add any other custom voiced followers to the framework, it might break their brain. 
 
 Almost all of these gameplay mods can be completely ignored, or fully embraced. The choice is yours.

  <summary>OStim</summary>
  
  ### OStim
  
  I tried as hard as I could to integrate this in way that makes sense and doesnt disrupt gameplay. It isnt perfect, but its getting there. We'd be here all day if I listed every mod being used, so I'll just go over a few of my personal favorites.
 
 * Rift's Rest
 
 A Witcher style brothel located in Riften. There's a few short stories centered around it that you might enjoy. 
 
 * OStim NPCs
 
 Allows NPCs to engage in scenes without your input. You might find some bandits having fun in a cave and you might hear some noises coming from a locked door in your local inn
 
 * OStim Solutions
 
 An adaptation of an old mod called Sexlab Solutions. You can finally roleplay as a D&D Bard, and fuck your way out of everything
 
 * OStim Lovers
 
 This is a mod that adds high quality fully voiced romance options to several vanilla NPCs. It is mainly intended for a female PC, but gay is okay so go ahead and have fun!
  
> OStim and its add-ons are configurable through their respective MCMs, most of them are neatly grouped together and can be found by just typing "O" in the MCM filter.
 
 Remember, OStim isnt just about sex, it adds another level of depth and realism to the game.

 <summary>Audio</summary>
 
 ### SFX
 
 Every vanilla sound has been improved or changed. A lot of these changes can be subjective, but luckily they can all be easily disabled by scrolling down to the ***Sounds*** seperator in MO2
 
 ### Music
 
 Just like SFX, the vanilla audio has been improved and a lot of new music has been added. Also, like the SFX changes, the additions can be incredibly subjective and are easily disabled by scrolling down to the ***Sounds*** seperator in MO2
 
 </details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Root Builder</summary>
 
 ### Root builder
 
 This is a MO2 plugin that can be used for anything that needs to be installed to the root directory of your game. This allows for easy management of things like skse, engine fixes, and ENB presets. While it can usually install simple things like older ENBs just fine, you should still make sure its done properly.
 
 To install a mod through root builder, select manual
 
 ![image](https://github.com/ArnoldDP/OStim-Community-Modlist/assets/122011472/b62aa5e3-ead0-4928-a00a-0649b42f94f7)
 
 Right click <data> and create a new directory named "root"
 
 Drag everything that should be installed to the root directory of your game into the "root" folder that you just created. Disable everything else.
 
 ![image](https://github.com/ArnoldDP/OStim-Community-Modlist/assets/122011472/77ba3828-d458-403a-b683-874c3b90c7b2)
 
Now just click okay. You can manage this like any other mod.


 
 ### ENB

Most of the included textures are Complex Parallax compatible. If an ENB preset you installed doesnt have complex parallax enabled by default, open up the enbseries.ini, and change the following settings to look like this

 1. EnableTerrainParallax=false
 2. EnableComplexGrass=true
 3. EnableComplexGrassCollisions=true
 4. EnableTerrainBlending=true
 5. EnableComplexParallax=true
 6. EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
 7. EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
 8. EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true

 
 If any of these lines are missing from the enbseries.ini, you can simply copy and paste the missing lines into the file. It will work just fine.

If you want to run NAT, Azurite, Vivid Weathers, or Aequinoctium weathers, you should enable ***FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps Weather and Lighting Fix.esp***

### ReShade and Community Shaders
 
Low graphics profile makes use of Community Shaders, by Doodlum. While its not quite as high end as ENB, it averages much better framerates while still keeping most of the nicer effects like complex grass and screenspace shadows. 
 
 </details>
 
 <details>
  <summary>Profiles</summary>
  
  # High
  
  * Weather and ENB
  
  This profile uses Rudy for NAT 3.1 with complex parallax enabled
  
  * LODs
  
  LODs are generated with 3D trees and dense grass, fargrid is not upgraded to neargrid.
  
  # Medium
  
  * Weather and ENB
  
  This profile uses Cathedral weathers + mists of tamriel along with Zandgar's edit of Rudy for Cathedral weathers. Complex parallax is also enabled.
  
  * LODs
  
  LODs are generated with billboards instead of the hybrid 3D meshes used for high settings. Grass LODs are also turned off.
  
  # Low
  
  * ReShade and Commmunity Shaders
  
  Community shaders is used instead of a weather+enb combo, it does not make use of complex parallax. This saves a ton of fps at the cost of a lot of high end lighting effects.
  
  * LODs
  
  LODs are the same as medium, billboards for trees and no grass LOD.
