# Ostim Community Modlist

Hello and thank you for reading this messy page. The list is currently being rebuilt from the ground up, for news and updates on this you are free to join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vYkTp86CcZ).

# General

<details>
 <summary>Description</summary>

### Goals

I feel like I need to preface this by stating that this is *not* pornrim with skimpy armor replacers, public masturbation, and sexually aggressive wolves. While you are free to install these mods if you *really* think that they're neccessary, you are not guaranteed to get any support with these things.

OCM is meant to expand on Skyrim with more modern RPG elements while simultaniously making the world feel more dynamic, lifelike, and immersive. This doesn't necessarily mean "vanilla+" though, think of it more as a "Skyrim 2". 

### Graphics

Graphics are a focal point for just about every list and this is no exception. 

With the rebuild, I decided to use NGVO as a base to save time. NGVO is a graphics focused list created by the incredibly dedicated author of Lorerim. Obviously there will be some differences considering the changes that needed to be made for Community Shaders and Seasons of Skyrim, but a majority of the graphics enhancements were left alone.

### Gameplay Overview

While the list is Simonrim based for the most part, there are a few more "aggressive" gameplay overhauls such as Gods and Worship or the plethora of survival changes. These mods serve to make some of the more overlooked aspects of the game a bit more important. The game will also be a bit more difficult but not nearly as hard as many of the soulslike lists out there. I think the term "souls-lite" describes it almost perfectly, not quite as punishing as something like Bloodborne but not as uninteresting as... Skyrim.

Melee combat has gotten the full modern combat overhaul treatment (no, not the MCO mod, but something extremely close). BFCO is used as an animation framework for third person combat animations while CFPAO handles first person. TK Dodge was chosen for several reasons, but the imporant one here is that it allows you to dodge in both third *and* first person. This is all wrapped neatly together by Plus Combat, an overhaul that allows for better stamina management, poise, timed blocking, better AI, and probably several other things I'm forgetting.

For the fans of magic out there, don't worry, you weren't forgotten about. Perk overhauls, several new spells from Darenii and Kittytail, and Spellsiphon make playing a mage equally rewarding and not just a firebolt stagger point and click adventure. There is also a simple but in depth lichdom mod for those of you who are tired of playing a vampire but still want something a bit more robust than a normal human.

Stealth didn't recieve as many changes as it did additions. Realistic AI Detection + Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection work in tandem to make sneaking more realistic while mods like Book of Shadows, Sneak Behavior Extensions, Take a Peek (and more universal mods such as Skyrim's Paraglider and Skyclimb) add entirely new mechanics to the playstyle. 

### New Lands and Quests

While this may not be as extensive as lists like Licentia, I try to have enough content for people to not get bored within 20 minutes. I don't want to spoil too much for the people who haven't played through quests like this so I'll try to keep things brief. 

Below you can find an exhaustive list of every quest, quest overhaul, follower, and dungeon mod.

 <summary>Installation</summary>
 
 ### Pre-Installation and Requirements
 
 You are required to start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim SE/AE through the Steam store. If you are unsure of how to do this, I recommend following GamerPoets guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ5uNCKOKmI).

 If you fail to start with a clean installation, the list will most likely not install. 

 Additionally, the game language needs to be set to english and you will need roughly 450Gbs of storage available. Once the list is done installing, you are free to delete the downloads folder to save some space.
 
| Performance | CPU    | GPU | RAM | Pagefile | 
| ----------- | ------ | --- | --- | -------- |
| Minimum  | Ryzen 7 5600 | RTX 2070/RX 6750 XT | 16gb @3200mhz | 40gb |
| Recommended | Ryzen 7 7600x | RTX 3070 TI/RX 6800 XT | 32gb @3600mhz | 40gb |

Since this list uses Community Shaders as opposed to an ENB, a high end GPU isn't a hard requirement for 1080p. A newish mid range card such as a 2070/3060 TI or RX 6750 XT will be enough for a stable framerate in most places. You are more likely going to be limited by your CPU than your GPU with this list. With that being said, a beefier card is almost always better so the recommended specs are a bit higher than the minimum.

**To users with an AMD 7xxx series card, please understand that you might run into problems with Community Shaders. It is recommended that you manually install a lightweight ENB (Silent Horizons 2 is what I'd recommend) to avoid problems.**


### Installation

This is going to be the hard part but thats alright, it's still pretty easy.

* **Installing Wabbajack**

  Feel free to skip this step if you've already done it.

  First navigate to [the Wabbajack website](https://www.wabbajack.org).

  Now you see that big download button? Click it. Now the next thing you'll want to do is create a folder for Wabbajack. It is extremely important that you do not create it in your downloads or documents folders, ideally it should be somewhere like ```C:\Wabbajack```.
  Now drag and drop the Wabbajack.exe file into the folder that you just created for it and then launch it.

  After its done installing, the application will automatically open. When it does, the first thing you'll want to do is look at the top right of the GUI and find the icon that looks like a gear. See it? Good, now click it.
  On the left hand side you'll see an option to log in to Nexus Mods. You absolutely need to do this for OCM and (as far as I'm aware) every other mod list hosted on Wabbajack. After youre done with this process, you can proceed to the next step.
  

* **Installing OCM**

  I would like to preface that by saying that while it is not technically a requirement, it is *highly* recommended that you have Nexus premium. If you don't, you'll have to click the download button about 1700 times on top of your download speed capped at 3Mb/s.
  
  To download OCM, select "Browse Modlists" on the left, the icon will look like a little cloud with an arrow pointing down. In the top right, click "Show NSFW" and "Show Unofficial Lists", now just give it a minute to load all of the images.
  Scroll down until you see the big white "OCM" banner, in the bottom right it will have a download icon. Once it's done downloading, that icon will turn into a play arrow, click it!

  You should see a new screen with things buttons for the discord, readme, website, and manifest in the bottom left. Don't worry about that stuff for now. On the right side, youll see "Modlist Installation Location" and "Resource Download Location".
  Click the three dots besides "Modlist Installation Location". Again, it's important that you create a new folder for your Wabbajack modlists, personally I'd recommend something like ```C:\OCM```. WJ should automatically set the download location for you but if you want something different for whatever reason, feel free to chang it.

  Now just walk away, go make some food and take a shower or something while you wait for Wabbajack to do its job, it will probably take a while.

### Post-Installation

  To launch the game, first you'll want to navigate to where you installed the list. This will be the "Modlist Installation Location" folder that you selected earlier. Find modorganizer.exe and double click it. On the top ride side of the screen there will be a box with a drop down menu and a smaller greenish blue box that says "run". Click on the drop down menu and make sure its set to "SKSE". Once its set to SKSE all you have to do is click run.

  Once you're in game and done with character customization, make a save by either opening up the menu manually and clicking "save game" or by just clicking F5 (this is set to use a full save, not a quicksave, dont worry) and then re-load the save. After that, click escape again and navigate to "Mod Configuration". Once you've found it, scroll down until you find "MCM Recorder" (or just use the search bar at the bottom) and select it. You'll see a few options on this page, but that's alright, you can ignore most all but two of them. Click on "RECORDER 1" and then click "Yes". It will instruct you to close out of the mod configuration menu, once you've done that youll see a menu with three options. Just select "Run Recording" and wait a few seconds, it will tell you when it's done. After you're done with all of this, save your game again and you're good to start playing. It is important to remember that autosaves are disabled in this list, so save your game and save it often.

Shared quarters are missing in a few Inn's. If you would like shared accomodations for you and your followers, check to see if theres a hatch anywhere on the floor first.

  <summary>OStim</summary>

 ### What it is

 OStim is a sex mod framework that can also be used for mods such as OBody. Three thousand hours on this game and you'd think our little dragonborn would have caught a couple bandits with their pants down by now, right? Well, now you can! Fade-to-black scenes are for the weak, I see no reason why games like Baldur's Gate and Cyberpunk can have detailed sex scenes and Skyrim can't.

 OStim is used over Sexlab for several reasons, namely that I value open-source work and quality over quantity. While Sexlab does have a huge pool of gameplay mods to pick from, OStim can be easily integrated in a realistic and non-fetishy way.

 ### How it's used

 With the goal being realistic integration, theres a chance you wont even notice it's there unless you really go looking for it. With that being said, here's the short list of mods that make use of it. 

 >OStim Lovers
>
A fairly in depth quest mod that, surprisingly enough, caters more to women than it does to men. I mean this for both in game and life. Feel free to read more about it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90053?tab=description)

>Followers
>
Several followers have patches that allow them to make use of the framework. For a detailed list, check the New Lands and Quests section of this readme.

>A few quest mods
>
A couple quests have OStim integration. For a detailed list, check the New Lands and Quests section of this readme.

 <summary>FAQ</summary>

>Can I make a suggestion?
>
Absolutely, ⁠the [suggestions](https://discord.gg/D6jTAatVT6) channel is open to the public. Bonus points to anything that's lore friendly.

>Can I add X mod?

I can't stop you, nor do I intend to. Just remember that I am not liable for any issues that arise because of mods added post-installation. I suggest that you familiarize yourself with the list before you make changes.

>My map is broken, what happened?
>
You have a mod loading after flat world map framework. Properly sort any mods that you add post installation otherwise a lot of things will be broken, not just the map.

>I want to use a different replacer for this NPC, how do I change it?
>
The simple way is to overwrite the "npcmerg2" mod found in the gen files separator near the bottom. Make sure you overwrite both the mod and the plugins.
The more difficult way to do it is to generate a new Easy NPC output. Refer to the mod page for a more detailed explanation on how to use the tool.

>Is Serana Dialogue Add-on included?
>
No.

>Will you add Serana Dialogue Add-on?
>
No.

>Why not?
>
Unlike other voiced followers, you do not have the option to forego using her if you want to progress through the game (being forced to use something is bad). She also forces you to give up on using vanilla Serana (subjective) if you had her installed at any point in your save.

>My game crashed! What do I do?
>
There will most likely be a crash log that can be found in ```C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE```. It will be called something like ```crash-xxxxp-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.log```. Feel free to drop it in the [general-support section of the discord](https://discord.gg/aSKsAJQhtr) along with any additional details you can give me.

  <summary>Root Builder and ReShade</summary>

 
 ### Root builder
 
 This is a MO2 plugin that I use to manage things like ENBs, ReShade, and SKSE.

 Chooey has made an amazing five minute guide on what it is and how to use it.

 https://youtu.be/m3QjdslU_6w?si=dykjTXWlBI-KmH8G&t=108

 If you need extra help doing any of this, feel free to stop by [Changes and Additions](https://discord.com/channels/1115971083624001606/1177489969711943700). Either myself or one of my extremely helpful community members will assist you.
 
 ### ReShade

 By default, ReShade is only enabled on the CS - Low profile. There is one (very simple) preset included, but you can easily create your own presets with the plethora of shaders or install other presets if you'd like.
