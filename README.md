# Unofficial Ostim Community Modlist

**Disclaimer:**

Ace's post is a little bit outdated. The modlist has grown to be more of a total game overhaul at this point. It now features several rather subjective changes, and while you are still absolutely able to modify it in any way you want, it may require slightly more in depth knowledge. The list is also now totalling around 250 gigs, a lot of this can be saved by just clearing the downloads folder after its done installing, but the jump from 140 to 250 may still be shocking to people who initially read his post.

In the future I might put together a stripped down version with just the bare essentials, but thats the future.

 <summary>Description</summary>

 ### Description
 
 
* What this isnt

This is not pornrim with barely clothed women, public masturebation, and sexually aggressive wolves, nor it is a hyperrealistic soulslike with a grueling survival mode and a map size that rivals Daggerfall. It's also not an Elysium Remastered clone (no disrespect to the original author) with the small addition of OStim.

* What this is

 It's an aesthetically pleasing and immersive overhaul for nearly every aspect of the game that stays true to The Elder Scrolls style, while adding plenty of spicy roleplay opportunities :^)

The gameplay mods are customizable enhancers to the vanilla Skyrim experience. A lot of subjective quest mods were avoided because they could cause unnecessary bloat.

 <summary>Preinstallation and Requirements</summary>
 
 ### Preinstallation
 
 It is recommended that you start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim through the Steam store (no GOG, sorry). A modified version may fail to install properly, if at all.
 If you downgraded, validate your files by going to your library, right clicking "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition", select properties, local files, and then click verify integrity of game files. Alternatively, you can completely uninstall the game and all related files and then reinstall it. After thats done, you can proceed with the installation.
 
 ### Requirements
 
 The only hard requirements to run this modlist are a CPU with AVX2 support and ~260 gigs of storage available.
 
> Recommended specs for 1080p:
> 
> CPU: Ryzen 5 5600/intel i5 11600k
>  
> GPU: RTX 3060 8gb/RX 6600 8gb
>  
> RAM: 16gb ddr4 @2666 mhz
> 
> ~~Basically just generic gaming pc built after 2020~~
> 
> Obviously if your hardware is better, there shouldn't be any issues.
 
 I tried to keep the textures around 2k, but a few misc items, notably mountains and female skin textures, are higher resolution. While the graphical fidelity isn't anywhere near as high as some modlists, it accomplishes my goal of making a list that looks nice, runs nice, and "feels" nice.

 ### Bugs and Installation Failures
 
 This list only really gets updated whenever any of the major mods it uses do, so small bugs may survive for a while. If you find any major/gamebreaking bugs, please report them to me on discord @Arnold#1526
 
If for any reason the Wabbajack installation fails, please DM me. More often than not this is because Boris put out an update for ENB without a version change, but theres always the chance that I screwed something up.

On the off chance that the game doesnt automatically downgrade, you can use the patcher below.

  <summary>A Brief explanation of the "major" gameplay changes</summary>
 
 ### Gameplay overhauls and rebalancing
 
 
 * Melee
 
Melee combat is handled by by ADXP + One Click Power Attack NG, as well as Valvalis Combat - Visceral Tactics. This is a patch that allows the mods Precision, Valhalla Combat, and Valravyn to work together in a cohesive way. Dodge - MCO is also provided. You can adjust these mods and their keybinds in their respective MCMs.

Chemmings Nordic animations for ADXP/MCO were chosen because I just felt like it would fit the best, but you are free to swap it out with any ADXP/MCO compatible moveset you'd like.
 
 * Magic
 
Magic has had dozens of new spells added to the game including Hemomancy, Mysticicsm, Abyss, Lunaris, and Natura. I also included Spellsiphon, an incredibly unique gameplay mod that can automatically integrate both vanilla and modded spells into its system should you choose to use it, the book can be found in High Hrothgar.

 * Races
 
Racial abilities are covered by Evolution - Skyrim Races Rejuvenated. It makes several small changes to make races feel more unique, and not just reskins with a minor power that youll rarely use.

 * Perks
 
Perks are handled by Vokrii. This is an extremely lightweight and minimalistic approach to perk overhauls. You can enjoy the small quality of life improvements it makes without being overwhelmed by an absurd number of changes.

 * Vampires and Werewolves
 
Lycanthropy and Vampirism are handled by Growl and Sacrilege. These two mods, like Vokrii, make small adjustments to the balance of these "diseases" that allows for more diverse and fun playstyles.

 * Stealth
 
Stealth had a few changes to make the vanilla thief more interesting. Book of Shadows adds several new systems such as takedowns, smokebombs, and more. Take a Peak is also included, and allows you to simply look through keyholes, maybe you'll see something fun? :^)
 
 * Survival
 
 Survival is handled by Sunhelm Survival and Camping Lite. These two mods are lightweight, customizable, and entirely optional. You can enable or disable survival through the MCM.
 
 * Camera
 
 True directional movement and Smoothcam are used to make third person gameplay feel a bit more modern. I included a few smoothcam presets, but theres hundreds that you can download off of Nexus if you dont like either of them (or you can just turn off smoothcam in the MCM). First person is handled by Improved Camera. It's also configured for clippingless first person OStim scenes. True direction movement has a target lock feature that is automatically set to m3 (middle mouse button) but this can be changed in the MCM, along with several other things.
 
 * User Interface
 
 The vanilla UI has been completely overhauled by several, fully customizable mods listed below
 
 1. SkyHUD
 2. TrueHUD
 3. MoreHUD
 4. A Matter of Time
 5. Untarnished UI
 
These can all be configured in their respective MCMs.
 
 Almost all of these gameplay mods can be completely ignored, or fully embraced. The choice is yours.

  <summary>OStim</summary>
  
  ### OStim
  
  I Tried as hard as I could to integrate this in way that makes sense and doesnt disrupt gameplay. It isnt perfect, but its getting there. We'd be here all day if I listed every mod being used, so I'll just go over a few of my personal favorites
 
 * Rift's Rest
 
 A Witcher style brothel located in Riften. There's a few short stories centered around it that you might enjoy. 
 
 * OStim NPCs
 
 Allows NPCs to engage in scenes without your input. You might find some bandits having fun in a cave and you might hear some noises coming from a locked door in your local inn
 
 * OStim Solutions
 
 An adaptation of an old mod called Sexlab Solutions. You can finally roleplay as a D&D Bard, and fuck your way out of everything
 
 * OStim Lovers
 
 This is a mod that adds high quality fully voiced romance options to several vanilla NPCs. It is mainly intended for a female PC, but gay is okay so go ahead and have fun!
  
> OStim and its add-ons are highly configurable through their respective MCMs, most of them are neatly grouped together and can be found by just typing "O" in the MCM filter.
 
 Remember, OStim isnt just about sex, it adds a lot more depth and realism to the game.

 <summary>Audio</summary>
 
 ### SFX
 
 Every vanilla sound has been improved or changed. A lot of these changes can be subjective, but luckily they can all be easily disabled by scrolling down to the ***Sounds*** seperator in MO2
 
 ### Music
 
 Just like SFX, the vanilla audio has been improved and a lot of new music has been added. Also, like the SFX changes, the additions can be incredibly subjective and are easily disabled by scrolling down to the ***Sounds*** in MO2

  <summary>ENBs, ReShade and Root Builder</summary>
 
 ### ENB

 Managing ENB presets is easier than ever thanks to Root Builder! Install them through MO2 like any other mod, and let Root Builder take care of it. If it doesn't work the first time, reinstall and select [Manual]
 
 Right click <data>, create directory, and name it "root". Then just drag and drop enbseries.ini, enblocal.ini, and the enbseries folder into the directory you just made. If done properly, it should look like this
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122011472/224231824-0c7f8f4b-c85d-42b3-bd82-0dbfc001d258.png)
 
 Now you can disable or enable it whenever you want just like any other mod :)

Most of the included textures are Complex Parallax compatible. If an ENB preset you installed doesnt have complex parallax enabled by default, open up the enbseries.ini, and change the following settings to look like this

 1. EnableTerrainParallax=false
 2. EnableComplexGrass=true
 3. EnableComplexGrassCollisions=true
 4. EnableTerrainBlending=true
 5. EnableComplexParallax=true
 6. EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
 7. EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
 8. EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true

 
 If any of these lines are missing from the enbseries.ini, you can simply copy and paste the missing lines into the file. It will work just fine.
 
 The list comes pre-installed with Rudy for NAT 3. Other ENB presets I highly recommend are NAT 3.1, Berserkyr, and Cabbage.

If you want to change the weather to anything other than NAT, Azurite, Vivid Weathers, or Aequinoctium, you should disable ***FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps Weather and Lighting Fix.esp***

### ReShade
 
Since I dont personally use ReShade, I unfortunately cannot write a very good guide on it. Thankfully, the legendary Sswaye himself has written an excellent guide. Check out his collection! https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78502

  Since there can't technically be an "official" OStim discord (to my knowledge), both of the servers listed are "official". Feel free to join both.

  I am simply compiling a list that I would be making for myself anyways. If you feel the need to donate, spin a wheel and pick any of the amazing authors above. They have put in hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of work to make Skyrim as good of a game as it is today.
