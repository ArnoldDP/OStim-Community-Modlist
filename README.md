# Ostim Community Modlist

Hello and thank you for reading this messy page. The list is currently being rebuilt from the ground up, for news and updates on this you are free to join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vYkTp86CcZ).

### Goals

OCM is meant to expand on Skyrim with more modern RPG elements while simultaniously making the world feel more dynamic, lifelike, and immersive. This is *not* pornrim with skimpy armor, public masturbation, and sexually aggressive wolves. 


### A General Overview

<details>
 <summary>Installation</summary>
 
 ### Pre-installation and Requirements
 
 You are required to start with a clean, unmodified, and up to date installation of Skyrim SE/AE through the Steam store. If you are unsure of how to do this, I recommend following GamerPoets guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ5uNCKOKmI)

 If you fail to start with a clean installation, the list will most likely not install. 

 The game language also needs to be set to English.
 
 The only hard requirements to run the modlist are a CPU with AVX2 support and ~450 gigs of storage available (you can delete the downloads folder later to save space).
 
| Performance | CPU    | GPU | RAM | Pagefile | 
| ----------- | ------ | --- | --- | -------- |
| Minimum  | Ryzen 7 5600 | RTX 2070/RX 6750 XT | 16gb @3200mhz | 20gb |
| Recommended | Ryzen 7 7600x | RTX 3070 ti/RX 6800 XT | 32gb @3600mhz | 40gb |

Since this list uses Community Shaders as opposed to an ENB, a high end GPU isn't a hard requirement for 1080p. A 2070 ti, 3060 ti, or rx 6750 XT will be enough for a stable framerate in most places. You are more likely going to be limited by your CPU than your GPU with this list. 

**To users with an AMD 7xxx series card, please understand that you might run into problems with Community Shaders. It is recommended that you manually install a lightweight ENB (such as Silent Horizons 2) to avoid problems.**


### Installation

This is going to be the hard part but thats alright, it's still pretty easy.

* **Installing Wabbajack**

  Feel free to skip this step if you've already done it

  First navigate to [the Wabbajack website](https://www.wabbajack.org).

  Now you see that big download button? Click it. Now the next thing you'll want to do is create a folder for Wabbajack. It is extremely important that you do not create it in your downloads or documents folders, ideally it should be somewhere like C:\Wabbajack.
  Now drag and drop the Wabbajack.exe file into the folder that you just created for it and then launch it.

  After its done installing, the application will automatically open. When it does, the first thing you'll want to do is look at the top right of the GUI and find the icon that looks like a gear. See it? Good, now click it.
  On the left hand side you'll see an option to log in to Nexus Mods. You absolutely need to do this for OCM and (as far as I'm aware) every other mod list hosted on Wabbajack. After youre done with this process, you can proceed to the next step.
  

* **Installing OCM**

  I would like to preface that by saying that while it is not technically a requirement, it is *highly* recommended that you have Nexus premium. If you don't, you'll have to click the download button about 1200 times on top of having your download speed capped at 3 mb/s.
  
  To download OCM, select "Browse Modlists" on the left, the icon will look like a little cloud with an arrow pointing down. In the top right, click "Show NSFW" and "Show Unofficial Lists", now just give it a minute to load all of the images.
  Scroll down until you see the big white "OCM" banner, in the bottom right it will have a download icon. Once it's done downloading, that icon will turn into a play arrow, click it!

  You should see a new screen with things buttons for the discord, readme, website, and manifest in the bottom left. Don't worry about that stuff for now. On the right side, youll see "Modlist Installation Location" and "Resource Download Location".
  Click the three dots besides "Modlist Installation Location". Again, it's important that you create a new folder for your Wabbajack modlists, personally I'd recommend something like C:\OCM. WJ should automatically set the download location for you but if you want something different for whatever reason, feel free to chang it.

  Now just walk away, go make some food and take a shower or something while you wait for Wabbajack to do its job, it will probably take a while.

### Post-Installation

  To launch the game, first you'll want to navigate to where you installed the list. This will be the "Modlist Installation Location" folder that you selected earlier. Find modorganizer.exe and double click it. On the top ride side of the screen there will be a box with a drop down menu and a smaller greenish blue box that says "run". Click on the drop down menu and make sure its set to "SKSE". Once its set to SKSE all you have to do is click run.

  Once you're in game and done with character customization, make a save by either opening up the menu manually and clicking "save game" or by just clicking F5 (this is set to use a full save, not a quicksave, dont worry) and then re-load the save. After that, click escape again and navigate to "Mod Configuration". Once you've found it, scroll down until you find "MCM Recorder" (or just use the search bar at the bottom) and select it. You'll see a few options on this page, but that's alright, you can ignore most all but two of them. Click on "RECORDER 1" and then click "Yes". It will instruct you to close out of the mod configuration menu, once you've done that youll see a menu with three options. Just select "Run Recording" and wait a few seconds, it will tell you when it's done. After you're done with all of this, save your game again and you're good to start playing. It is important to remember that autosaves are disabled in this list, so save your game and save it often.

Shared quarters are missing in a few Inn's. If you would like shared accomodations for you and your followers, check to see if theres a hatch anywhere on the floor first.

  <summary>OStim</summary>

  Obviously this list does have a fair amount of OStim integration. While most of it can be completely ignored if you want to, there are a few things to watch out for.

  * A few of the followers

    Several of the followers, namely Auri, Caesia, Nessa, Kaidan, and M'rissi have OStim integration in their romance quests.

  * General Dialogue

    OStim Romance adds a fairly simple and straightforward dialogue based way to get people in bed with you.

<details>
 <summary>Audio</summary>

 While this list isn't built to be an auditory experience, everyone likes good audio. 
 
 Every vanilla sound has been improved or changed. Most of this comes from Audio Overhaul for Skyrim, Immersive Sounds Compendium, several SFX replacers by Satafinix, and Unofficial HD Audio Project. These mods cannot be safely disabled without running your own synthesis patch.
 
 Just like SFX, the vanilla OST has improved clarity and songs from the mods Nyghtfall, Around the Fire, and Still have been added. The additions can be incredibly subjective, so you can easily disable it by disabling "big old music mod" in the **Audio** separator.

 <summary>FAQ</summary>

*Can I make a suggestion?*


Absolutely, ‚Å†[suggestions](https://discord.gg/D6jTAatVT6) is open to the public. Bonus points to anything that's lore friendly.

*Can I add "x mod"?*

I can't stop you, nor do I intend to. Just remember that I am not liable for any issues that arise because of mods added post-installation. I suggest that you familiarize yourself with the list before you make changes.

*My map is broken!*

You have a mod loading after flat world map framework. Properly sort any mods that you add post installation otherwise a lot of things will be broken, not just the map.

*I want to change the replacer for "x character". How can I do that?*

The simple way is to overwrite the "npcmerg2" mod found in the gen files separator near the bottom. Make sure you overwrite both the mod and the plugins
The more difficult way to do it is to generate a new Easy NPC output. Refer to the mod page for a more detailed explanation on how to use the tool.

*How do I fast travel?*

Innkeepers and some general stores will sell an item called a Travel Pack. Left click this item in your inventory and it will allow you to fast travel

*Is Serana Dialogue Add-on included?*

No

*Will you add Serana Dialogue Add-on?*

No, but you can

*Why not?*

Unlike other voiced followers, you do not have the option to forego using her if you want to progress through the game (being forced to use something is bad). She also forces you to give up on using vanilla Serana (subjective) if you had her installed at any point in your save.

*My game crashed! What do I do?*

There will most likely be a crash log that can be found in C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE, it will be called something like "crash-bunch of numbers". Feel free to drop it in the [general-support section of the discord](https://discord.gg/aSKsAJQhtr)

  <summary>Root Builder, ENB and ReShade</summary>

 
 ### Root builder
 
 This is a MO2 plugin that I use to manage things like ENBs, ReShade, and SKSE.

 Chooey has made an amazing five minute guide on what it is and how to use it.

 https://youtu.be/m3QjdslU_6w?si=dykjTXWlBI-KmH8G&t=108

 If you need extra help doing any of this, feel free to stop by [Changes and Additions](https://discord.com/channels/1115971083624001606/1177489969711943700). Either myself or one of my extremely helpful community members will assist you.
 
 ### ENB

 By default, the list uses a custom ENB preset based on Silent Horizons 2 by KitsuuneNivis. It was set up specifically for the rather peculiar weather + interior combo, so you will most likely want to disable Aequinoctium + SiL if you want to change to something else. Don't worry, you wont hurt my feelings if you want to change it, its nothing more than a party trick compared to some of the top tier ENB presets out there.

 ### ReShade

 By default, ReShade is only enabled on the CS - Low profile. There is one (very simple) preset included, but you can easily create your own presets with the plethora of shaders or install other presets if you'd like.
