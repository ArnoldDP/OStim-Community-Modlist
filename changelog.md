# Changelog

<details>
  <summary>1.2.0</summary>

  Sorry for the late update everyone. School has kept me pretty busy lately.
  
    -Added Seasonal Landscapes - Unfronze

      Areas normally covered in snow (Winterhold, The Pale, Eastmarch, etc) will now have seasonal variation.

    -Added Dungeons Revisited

    -Reintroduced Race Based Textures (if you find any neck seams, post it in the discord and I'll make note of it)

      NOTE: Futa support is still limited

    -Added Billy's Wall Pack for OStim SA

    -Added Anub's animations for OStim SA

    -Added Additional Dremora Faces + Dremora Line Expansion

    -Added Whiterun Has Walls

    -Added KJ747's Whiterun Market

    -Added Simplicity of Sea. This doubles as a better water mod a better horizon seam.

    -Added TP Armor Mashup with a 12% chance of being distributed to higher level female vampires.

    -Added out of the box support for 2560x1080p ultrawide displays. Found as an optional mod in the optional mods separator.

    -Removed JK's Whiterun

    -Removed TGC Rorikstead

      TGC Rorikstead, while looking amazing, broke Nessa's intro quest. I do not have enough knowledge to make a patch for this myself, and modded followers take priority.

    -Removed craftable cock and balls. Futa is only available through the MCM.

    -Removed flyers

    -Removed Yes I'm Sure NG

      At least five crash logs were pointing towards this mod. It looks like a conflict with Thaumaturgy and I do not have the knowledge to fix it myself. Thaumaturgy takes priority.

    -Removed some of the frankly ridiculous bodyslide presets

    -Added an OBody NG Config Preset. This can be disabled if you made a custom one or if you just dont want to use it

    -Fixed broken fire in Markarth and other areas

    -Nessa shouldn't be naked anymore, at least not for long.

    -Small update to the Kreate preset used for the Community Shaders profile

    -Community Shaders shader cache is now pre-compiled
